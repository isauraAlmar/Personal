# Final Project

## INTRODUCTION

### About the company

Everis an NTT DATA Company is a multinational consulting firm that offers business and strategic solutions, development and maintenance of technological applications and outsourcing services. The company has grown organically, in double digits and reported 1.03 billion Euro in turnover last year. It currently employs 19,000 professionals at its offices and high performance centers in 16 countries.

The companye starts on October 1996 in Spain,  when group of 5 entrepreneurs left their managerial positions at a leading consulting company to create a new concept of consulting. The idea was simple to explain, but complex to implement: build from scratch a unique company model designed to attract and retain the best talent, while fostering good people and collective values. Our talent management model, the main asset of Everis, is taught as a case study in leading business schools, as it excels in smartly feeding both the brain (skills and professional growth) and the heart (attitudes and values) of our employees. The result is summarized in our claim: attitude makes the difference.

What everis can do for companyes:

### Problem Definition

## Analysis and reserch

### Introduction

These section is about defaining the needs of the project leanring the theory that is need and rerech about witch tecnologies can be use and witch ones may work better.

### Requisits

### RELATIONAL vs NoSQL 

#### Limitations of Relational Databases
Nowadays the amount of data that needs to store and the process has been increasing in big quantities,and with it new terms have come as "BIG DATA", "internet of things" or "Analitics. The way of supporting large numbers of users from companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. change the way of managing data than smaller numbers of business users. 

Web applications serving tens of thousands or more users were difficult to implement with relational databases. Four characteristics of data management systems that are particularly important for large-scale    data management tasks are:

* Scalability: The way to scale the amount of that in the pass was by Scale up (upgraded with more CPUs, additional memory, or faster storage devices). Scaling up is always a cost concern, and you always are restricted for the hardware capacity. Another option is to use multiple servers but managing a relational DB using different servers increase the complexity and the difficulty.

* Cost: Upgrading with better hardward always have a huge impac of cost bea

* Flexibility: 

* Availability: Being able to quering is one of the big problems when you have milions of users accesisng the information at almost the same time from anywhere in the worl. Definaitly we need to enshure that the database have the way to enhure the datta when there is infraestructure problems, or system errors. With Relational Databases is not a easy problem to solve, it can become a very cmplicate problem when maximizes the availability is needed. 

#### NoSQL 

The idea of the NoSQL database is to solve the problems that the tipical relational database have. A good definition for a NoSQL is a variety of different database tecnologies that are being non-relational as we mantione before that is one of the problems that we are having with very larg amount of Data, it is also distributed meaning that ther can they can be vinculate to multiple processors. An other catacheristics of the NoSQL is that they have to be horizontally scalable, that means that we can increase the number of the nodes, and not having to scale verticly, incrise the sise of the node.

!!DRAW OF VERTICAL AN HORITZONTAL scaling.


When we talck about big data we have 4 dimentions or the 4 V: 

* Volume:

* Variety:

* Varacity:

* Velocity:


#### Types of NoSQL

* Column Families: 


* Document Store

A document store allows the inserting, retrieving, and manipulating of semi-structured data. Most of the  databases available under this category use XML, JSON, with data access typically over HTTP protocol using RESTful API

Document-oriented databases provide this flexibility—dynamic or changeable schema or even schemaless documents. Because of the limitless flexibility provided in this model, this is one of the more popular models implemented and used. Some of popular databases that provide document-oriented storage include:


* Key Value

When we talk about key value database we need to imagine an array that have constains on the keys and the values. That king of array is what we call associative array. The advantages that you can have on a key value database over an associative array is the percistance of the data especially in long tearm storage.

The idea of a key value is to be able to the fast acces of the data, that is the reason why some key value stores only use memory to keep the data instead of saving it into the disck. 

It is good to implemeant these kind of database when you need to use many times a data, so when we getit form the disck we s

* Graph Databases

* Colum base Database

* Multimodel Databases


### Architectura
#### SOA
#### Michroservices 

##### Container

##### CAP Therorem

Also known as Brewer’s theorem states that distributed databases cannot have concistenci Availability and Partitiob Tolerance all at the ssame time.

* Consistency: consistent copies of data on different servers.

* Availability: refers	to providing a response	to any query

* Partition Tolerance: 	means if a network that connects two or	more data ase servers fails, the servers will still be	available with consistent data.

##### ACID:	
*Atomicity: A unit that cannot be further divided.	

*Consistency: Ensure the integration of data.

*Isolation:

*Durability:
	
##### BASE:	

*Basically:	

*Available:	

*Soft State:

*Eventually Consistent:

#### Cassandra:
Apache Cassandra is open source, distributed data storage system that differs sharply from relational database management systems.

Cassandra is a NoSQL usin  Column Store model. 
![alt text](https://github.com/isauraAlmar/Personal/blob/master/elassandraarchitecture.jpg)
##### The History of Cassandra

Cassandra first started as an incubation project at Apache in January of 2009. Shortly thereafter, the committers, led by Apache Cassandra Project Chair Jonathan Ellis, re-leased version 0.3 of Cassandra, and have steadily made minor releases since that time.

Though as of this writing it has not yet reached a 1.0 release, Cassandra is being used in production by some of the biggest properties on the Web, including Facebook,Twitter, Cisco, Rackspace, Digg, Cloudkick, Reddit, and more. \[book]

Releases after graduation include:

    0.6, released Apr 12 2010, added support for integrated caching, and Apache Hadoop MapReduce
    0.7, released Jan 08 2011, added secondary indexes and online schema changes
    0.8, released Jun 2 2011, added the Cassandra Query Language (CQL), self-tuning memtables, and support for zero-downtime upgrades
    1.0, released Oct 17 2011, added integrated compression, leveled compaction, and improved read performance
    1.1, released Apr 23 2012, added self-tuning caches, row-level isolation, and support for mixed ssd/spinning disk deployments
    1.2, released Jan 2 2013, added clustering across virtual nodes, inter-node communication, atomic batches, and request tracing
    2.0, released Sep 4 2013, added lightweight transactions (based on the Paxos consensus protocol), triggers, improved compactions, CQL paging support, prepared statement support, SELECT column alias support

##### Why Cassandra

* Scalability: In the system is very importat to desing for a scalability because the wroth plane is that we cpuld have like a milion robot in a year. So casandra is prepared to have a hight scalability performance. 

* Write Speed: It is importan that when the system want to save new information it does fast because ther may be alot of information to save. One of the exemples that neds to be fast is when you save all the interaction infrmation as a log.

* It provides high availability: 

* Designed to manage very large amounts of structured data like logs.

* Peer-to-peer distribution model. 

* The gossiper is a protocol communication (to support decentralization and partition tolerance) responsible for making sure every node in the system eventually knows important information about every other node's state, including those that are unreachable or not yet in the cluster when any given state change occurs. 

* It have AntiEntropy,  it is a synchronization mechanisme that consist in comparing all the replicas of each piece of data that exist (or are supposed to) and updating each replica to the newest version. 

* CQL (Cassandra Query Language), it is a subsed of SQL and its easy for someone coming from SQL to learn. 


#### ElasticSerch
Elasticsearch is a a distributed search engine base on RESTful, capable of solving a growing number of use cases. It can be use as an analitic framework and datastore as well.

INDEX: 

INDEXING: Is the acction to recive a document and store/process in an index.

SEARCHING: is the acction to retretive the data from the index.

MAPPING

* Mapping base types:
* Mapping arrays
* Mapping an object
* Mapping a document

##### History

Elasticsearch had the first vertion realise created for Shay Banon in Febrary 2010. Shay Banon had a scalability isure with Compass and he decide to rewrite and used a common interface, JSON over HTTP, suitable for programming languages other than Java as well.

##### Why Elasticserch

One of the advantages of Elasticsearch is that you can create a clienr made of any language as the answer is a JSON object. The main advantages of these protocl ar:

* Protavility: It use web standars soc ic can be implementet in meny languages such as Java, Python, Ruby, c# etc, or called form comand lines applications such as curl.
 * Durability:
* Simple to use:
* High suportet: Alot of plugings suoirts a REST endpoint on HTTP.
* Scalability:  Is the same to talk to Elasticsearch running on a single node than hundred of them. It scales horizontally to handle kajillions of events per second, while automatically managing how indices and queries are distributed across the cluster for oh-so smooth operations.
* Speed:

Anothe good pont of elastic search is its comunity that ptovides official dtivers that suports the most use programming languages and powerful pluguings like BigDesk, Head, HQ, Kopf, and Paramedic.


* Resilient, Highly Available

#### Docker

##### History
##### Characteristics
##### Why Docker

* Portability: Everything required to run the application is packaged into a standardized container which means your applications are no longer restrained to certain infrastructure requirements. Applications can move across multiple environments, development stages, and cloud environments - consistently.

* Incrise security: The Docker EE platform provides you with all the tools and capabilities you need to run containers securely at scale. With services like security scanning and container signing, Docker EE enables you to protect all app components from the source, across the network, and to different collaborators and environments with guarantees against tampering.

* Efficiency: By containerizing your legacy application on Docker Enterprise Edition (EE), you reduce the total resource requirements to run your application. This increases operational efficiency and allows you to consolidate your infrastructure.





#### Elisandra = Elasticserch + Casandra

Elassandra is a fork of Elasticsearch modified to run as a plugin for Apache Cassandra in a scalable and resilient peer-to-peer architecture. Elasticsearch code is embedded in Cassanda nodes providing advanced search features on Cassandra tables and Cassandra serve as an Elasticsearch data and configuration store.

##### History
##### Characteristics
##### Why Elassandra

An Elasticsearch index is mapped to a cassandra keyspace, and a document type to a cassandra table.
