## INTRODUCTION

### About the company

Everis an NTT DATA Company is a multinational consulting firm that offers business and strategic solutions, development and maintenance of technological applications and outsourcing services. The company has grown organically, in double digits and reported 1.03 billion Euro in turnover last year. It currently employs 19,000 professionals at its offices and high-performance centers in 16 countries.

The company started in Spain on October 1996, when a group of 5 entrepreneurs left their managerial positions at a leading consulting company to create a new concept of consulting. The idea was simple to explain, but complex to implement: build from scratch a unique company model designed to attract and retain the best talent, while fostering good people and collective values. Our talent management model, the main asset of Everis, is taught as a case study in leading business schools, as it excels in smartly feeding both the brain (skills and professional growth) and the heart (attitudes and values) of our employees. The result is summarized in our claim: attitude makes the difference. 

What Everis can do for companies:

### Problem Definition

## Analysis and reserch

### Introduction

These section is about defining the needs of the project learning the theory that is needed and research about witch technologies can be use and which ones may work better. 

### Requisits ???

### RELATIONAL vs NoSQL 

#### Limitations of Relational Databases
Nowadays the amount of data that needs to be stored and the processed has been increasing in big quantities, and with it new terms have come such as "BIG DATA", "Internet of Things" or "Analytics". The way of supporting large numbers of users from companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. change the way of managing data than smaller numbers of business users.  
  
Web applications serving tens of thousands or more users were difficult to implement with relational databases. Four characteristics of data management systems that are particularly important for large-scale data management tasks are: 
  
* Scalability: The way to scale the amount of that in the pass was by Scale up (upgraded with more CPUs, additional memory, or faster storage devices). Scaling up is always a cost concern, and you always are restricted for the hardware capacity. Another option is to use multiple servers but managing a relational DB using different servers increase the complexity and the difficulty. 
  
* Cost: Upgrading with better hardware always have a huge impact of cost ?????? 
  
* Flexibility:   

* Availability: Being able to querying is one of the big problems when you have millions of users accessing the information at almost the same time from anywhere in the world. We need to ensure that the database has a way to ensure that the data when there are infrastructure problems, or system errors. With Relational Databases is not an easy problem to solve, it can become a very complicated problem when maximizes the availability is needed.  

#### NoSQL 

The idea of the NoSQL database is to solve the problems that the typical relational database has. A good definition for a NoSQL is a variety of different database technologies that are being non-relational as we mentioned before that is one of the problems that we are having with very large amount of Data, it is also distributed meaning that they can be inculcate to multiple processors. Another characteristic of the NoSQL is that they have to be horizontally scalable, that means that we can increase the number of the nodes, and not having to scale vertically, increase the size of the node. 
  
!!DRAW OF VERTICAL AN HORITZONTAL scaling. 
  
  
When we talk about big data we have 4 dimensions or the 4 V:   

* Volume: It refers the amount of data. We have many sources that the data can be generated form. For exemple: Logs, senors, social media, speeach, events, etc. 

* Variety: It refers the types of data that we can have. It can be structured, semi-structured or unstructured. The data can come from two main sources: people who create the data and or machines. In the case of the people it is going to be more structure. And in the case of machines it depends. 

* Veracity: How truthy is the data. In some cases, we can have untrusted data, for example if you have a node replicated many times and the data it is not consistent between them. 

* Velocity: The velocity that we need to process the data either the speed of generating (and saving) the data and the read of analysis.  
https://bicorner.com/2015/06/25/characteristics-that-make-big-data-big/ (1/12/2017)

#### Types of NoSQL

* Column Families: 

These types of Database are designed to manage big amount of data distributed on multiple servers in a cluster. If you only have one server probably these type of data is not what you need. 

EXPLAIN HOW IT WORKS

* Document Store 
  
A document store allows the inserting, retrieving, and manipulating of semi-structured data. Most of the databases available under this category use XML, JSON, with data access typically over HTTP protocol using RESTful API 
  
Document-oriented databases provide this flexibilityâ€”dynamic or changeable schema or even schemless documents. Because of the limitless flexibility provided in this model, this is one of the more popular models implemented and used. Some of popular databases that provide document-oriented storage include: 


* Key Value

When we talk about key value database we need to imagine an array that have constrains on the keys and the values. That king of array is what we call associative array. The advantages that you can have on a key value database over an associative array is the persistence of the data especially in long term storage. 
  
The idea of a key value is to be able to the fast access of the data, that is the reason why some key value stores only use memory to keep the data instead of saving it into the disk.  
  
It is good to implement these kinds of database when you need to use many times a data, so when we get it form the disk it saves the data to the cache in order to access it faster. 

* Graph Databases 
  
Graph Databases as its name suggest, is a database base on the mathematical element name graph. A graph consists on two parts, vertices and edges, where a Vertices represents thinks (it can be anything, cities, animals, stations, etc.) that have relationships with other thinks. On the other hand, edges are the links that connect vertices and represents its relationships. The relationships can be long or short term. 
  
* Multimodal Databases 
  
Sometimes one type of database it does not required all the characteristics of the system. Sometimes is good to combine the different models for a better performance. For example, when a user logs into the system it might need to access the data of the user many times, a good possibility for having better speed is to use a SQL database that needs to be done  

### Architectura 
#### SOA 
#### Microservices  
  
##### Container 
  
##### CAP Theorem 

Also known as Brewerâ€™s theorem states that distributed databases cannot have consistency Availability and Partition Tolerance all at the same time. 
  
* Consistency: consistent copies of data on different servers. 
  
* Availability: refers    to providing a response    to any query 
  
* Partition Tolerance: means if a network that connects two or more databases and if one servers fails, the servers will still be one available with consistent data. 

##### ACID:	
*Atomicity: A unit that cannot be further divided.	

*Consistency: Ensure the integration of data.

*Isolation:

*Durability:
	
##### BASE:	

*Basically:	

*Available:	

*Soft State:

*Eventually Consistent:

## PROJECT DEVELOPMENT 

### Introduction

In this section It describes the research about which technologies that can be used to solve the database problem, and a comparison between them to find which ones can be the best. It is also to define the architecture of the system and which technologies that can be used to implement it.  
  
### Technologies 
  
Table of Database different technologies and its advantages and disadvantages. 
  
| Tecnology |type | Advantage | disadvantages  | 
| ---------------- |:--------------------|:-----------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------:| 
| Apache Cassandra | column store      | open source. Per to per architecture. Scheme free. | $1600                    | 
| MongoDB          | document store | Schema less |            $12                            |

#### Cassandra:
Apache Cassandra is open source, distributed data storage system that differs sharply from relational database management systems. 
  
Cassandra is a NoSQL using Column Store model. It has a primary language call CQL (Cassandra Query Language) that is use for communicating with the database.  
  
![alt text](https://github.com/isauraAlmar/Personal/blob/master/Screenshot from 2017-12-04 15-50-51.png) 
  
##### The History of Cassandra 
  
Cassandra first started as an incubation project at Apache in January of 2009. Shortly thereafter, the committers, led by Apache Cassandra Project Chair Jonathan Ellis, re-leased version 0.3 of Cassandra, and have steadily made minor releases since that time. 
  
Though as of this writing it has not yet reached a 1.0 release, Cassandra is being used in production by some of the biggest properties on the Web, including Facebook, Twitter, Cisco, Rackspace, Digg, Cloud kick, Reddit, and more. \[book]

Releases after graduation include:

    0.6, released Apr 12 2010, added support for integrated caching, and Apache Hadoop MapReduce
    0.7, released Jan 08 2011, added secondary indexes and online schema changes
    0.8, released Jun 2 2011, added the Cassandra Query Language (CQL), self-tuning memtables, and support for zero-downtime upgrades
    1.0, released Oct 17 2011, added integrated compression, leveled compaction, and improved read performance
    1.1, released Apr 23 2012, added self-tuning caches, row-level isolation, and support for mixed ssd/spinning disk deployments
    1.2, released Jan 2 2013, added clustering across virtual nodes, inter-node communication, atomic batches, and request tracing
    2.0, released Sep 4 2013, added lightweight transactions (based on the Paxos consensus protocol), triggers, improved compactions, CQL paging support, prepared statement support, SELECT column alias support

##### Why Cassandra
** Scalability: In the system is very important to design for a scalability because the company could decide to add hundreds of new robots over a short period of time. So, Cassandra is prepared to have a high scalability performance.  
  
* Write Speed: It is important that when the system want to save new information it does fast because there may be vast amounts of information to save. One of the examples that needs to be fast is when you save all the interaction information as a log. 
  
* It provides high availability:  
  
* Designed to manage very large amounts of structured data like logs. 
  
* Peer-to-peer distribution model.  
  
* The gossiper is a protocol communication (to support decentralization and partition tolerance) responsible for making sure every node in the system eventually knows important information about every other node's state, including those that are unreachable or not yet in the cluster when any given state change occurs.  
  
* It have AntiEntropy,  it is a synchronization mechanism that consist in comparing all the replicas of each piece of data that exist (or are supposed to) and updating each replica to the newest version.  
  
* CQL (Cassandra Query Language), it is a subset of SQL and its easy for someone coming from SQL to learn.  
  
  
#### Elasticsearch 
  
Elasticsearch is a search engine base on RESTful, that have two main functions: it can be used as an analytic framework and datastore as well. 
  
It can be used for several cases:  
* As a Text Search. 
* Event Data and Metrics. 
* Visualizing Data. 
* Scraping and Combining Public Data. 
* Logging and Log Analysis. 
  
INDEX:  
  
INDEXING: Is the action to receive a document and store/process in an index. 
  
SEARCHING: is the action to retrieve the data from the index. 
  
MAPPING 
  
* Mapping base types: 
* Mapping arrays 
* Mapping an object 
* Mapping a document 
  
... 
  
NODE: 
  
CLUSTER: 
  
  
  
##### History 
  
Elasticsearch had the first version released  for Shay Banon in Febrary 2010. Shay Banon had a scalability issue with Compass and he decide to rewrite and used a common interface, JSON over HTTP, suitable for programming languages other than Java as well. 
  
##### Why Elasticsearch 
  
One of the advantages of Elasticsearch is that you can create a client made of any language as the answer is a JSON object. The main advantages of these protocol are: 
  
* Portability: It use web standards so it can be implemented in many languages such as Java, Python, Ruby, c#, etc., or called form command lines applications such as curl. 
* Durability: 
* Simple to use: 
* High support: Alot of plugins uses a REST endpoint on HTTP. 
* Scalability:  Is the same to talk to Elasticsearch running on a single node than hundreds of them. It scales horizontally to handle billions of events per second, while automatically managing how indices and queries are distributed across the cluster for oh-so smooth operations. 
* Speed: 
  
  
There are several reasons for use Elasticsearch instead of other search engines. First of all is because it has a big community that maintain and use it. That can be really useful at the time to solve problems or learn how to use it. Another reason is because the community apart official rivers that support the most use programming languages. 
  
  
* Resilient, Highly Available 
  
#### Docker 
  
Docker is a container technology that is create 
##### History 
##### Characteristics 
##### Why Docker 
  
* Portability: Everything required to run the application is packaged into a standardized container which means your applications are no longer restrained to certain infrastructure requirements. Applications can move across multiple environments, development stages, and cloud environments - consistently. 
  
* Increase security: The Docker EE platform provides you with all the tools and capabilities you need to run containers securely at scale. With services like security scanning and container signing, Docker EE enables you to protect all app components from the source, across the network, and to different collaborators and environments with guarantees against tampering. 
  
* Efficiency: By containerizing your legacy application on Docker Enterprise Edition (EE), you reduce the total resource requirements to run your application. This increases operational efficiency and allows you to consolidate your infrastructure. 
  
  
  
  
  
#### Elisandra = Elasticserch + Casandra 
  
Elassandra is a fork of Elasticsearch modified to run as a plugin for Apache Cassandra in a scalable and resilient peer-to-peer architecture. Elasticsearch code is embedded in Cassanda nodes providing advanced search features on Cassandra tables and Cassandra serve as an Elasticsearch data and configuration store.
